# fs-extra-q-promise.js

# Node file system library and fs-extra module promisified with Q

Exactly the same as [fs-extra-promise](https://github.com/overlookmotel/fs-extra-promise) but with Q instead of bluebird. For any further documentation and examples, look at that project.

`npm install fs-extra-q-promise`
