# fs-extra-q

## Node file system library and fs-extra module promisified with Q

Exactly the same as [fs-extra-promise](https://github.com/overlookmotel/fs-extra-promise) but with Q instead of bluebird. For any further documentation and examples, look at that project.

[`npm install fs-extra-q`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fs-extra-q)
